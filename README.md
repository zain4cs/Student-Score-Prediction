Student Exam Performance Prediction

This project predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on two features:

Study Hours

Previous Exam Score

The workflow includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

Summary

Random Forest achieved perfect performance with 100 percent accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Logistic Regression performed well but had lower accuracy compared to Random Forest.

Study Hours and Previous Exam Score were strong indicators of student performance.
